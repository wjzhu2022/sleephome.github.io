Adults should sleep 7 or more hours per night on a regular basis to promote optimal health[1]. However, more than one-third of the US population gets less than the recommended amount of sleep (https://aasm.org/seven-or-more-hours-of-sleep-per-night-a-health-necessity-for-adults/). 
Not getting enough sleep is linked with chronic diseases and adverse health conditions[1], threateniing the nationâ€™s overall public health. Short sleep duration along with other dimensions of poor sleep has been associated with weight gain and obesity[2], type 2 diabetes[3],  increased risk of hypertension[4], cardiovascular disease[5] and depression[6, 7]. Sleep deprivation and disorders are also associated with impaired immune function[8], chronic pain[9], impaired performance, increased errors, and greater risk of accidents[10].
